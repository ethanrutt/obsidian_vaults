## CIA-Triad
- Availability
- Integrity
- Confidentiality
## You-don't-need-to-outrun-the-bear
- You just have to outrun the other people, because the bear will stop to eat them
- In the same case, you don't have to have the best security to deter the best attackers, only better than other companies who have similar products.
- relative security
	- i.e.
		- having an ADT sign in your front lawn when your neighbors don't
## Deference-in-Depth
- Layered Security
	- No single security measure is foolproof, so use multiple layers of defense
		- i.e.
			- firewalls
			- intrusion detection/prevention
			- encryption
			- access control
			- user awareness training
			- even if password is compromised, multi-factor auth adds extra barrier
## A Chain is Only as Strong as its Weakest Link
- Security depends on the weakest component. More often than not, this is people
	- i.e.
		- Social engineering
		- Phishing
		- Unpatched software vulnerabilities
## Everything can be Hacked
- Assumption of breach
	- Assume that every system is vulnerable; it's just a matter of time and effort
		- i.e.
			- High profile hacks like SolarWinds, Colonial Pipeline
			- IoT devices exploited due to weak default credentials
	- Focus on breach detection, response, and minimizing damage, not just prevention
