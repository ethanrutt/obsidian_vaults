# What is Risk?
- Probability of an event occuring that affects objectives
- Threats, vulnerabilities, consequences
	-  Risk Identification
	-  Risk Assessment
	-  Risk Mitigation
- Cybersecurity doesn't exist in isolation, there is an overlap
- Motivation
	- Pleasure
	- Ego
	- Money
	- Chaos
	- Activism

## Risk Treatment
- process of selecting and implementing measures to modify risk
- **objective**: align residual risk with the organization's risk appetite
- 4 core strategies
	- [Risk Avoidance](#Risk-Avoidance)
	- [Risk Mitigation](#Risk-Mitigation)
	- [Risk Transference](#Risk-Transference)
	- [Risk Acceptance](#Risk-Acceptance)
## Risk-Avoidance
- eliminating the risk entirely by avoiding activities that introduce risk
	- i.e.
		- discontinuing use of high-risk applications
		- avoiding partnerships
	- advantages
		- reduces risk to 0
	- disadvantages
		- limits business opportunities
## Risk-Mitigation
- Reducing likelihood or impact of a risk
	- i.e.
		- implementing firewalls and intrusion detection systems
		- employee cybersec awareness training
	- advantages
		- retains activity while reducing risk to acceptable levels
	- disadvantages
		- requires continuous effort and resources
## Risk-Transference
- Shifting risk to another party
	- i.e.
		- Purchasing cyber liability insurance
		- outsourcing services to managed security providers
	- advantages
		- limits financial impact
	- disadvantages
		- doesn't eliminate risk entirely
## Risk-Acceptance
- Acknowledging risk without further action
	- i.e.
		- accepting low-risk vulnerabilities that are costly to fix
	- advantages
		- cost-effective for minor risks
	- disadvantages
		- requires careful monitoring to avoid escalation
