### A shell tool that makes creating and attaching easy

* to use
```bash
tmuxster [-n session_name]
```

* using dry will let you fuzzy find through your existing tmux sessions, and attach to the one that you select
* using with -n argument will instead create a new session with the name that you gave, and then fuzzy find your way to the starting directory

---

### Potential Add-ons
* Some type of config file for certain `session_names` similar to what `tmuxifier` does
* check out more `tmux` commands and see what else I could do
