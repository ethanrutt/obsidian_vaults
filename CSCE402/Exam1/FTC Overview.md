- FTC is the go-to federal agency to investigate **data breaches**
- **DOESN'T go after hackers**, it goes against the **companies** where the **breaches occurred**
- If a company is breached, did they enable this breach due to poor cybersecurity practices?
# How Laws are Made
- statutory laws
	- U.S.C., state, local
- administrative laws
	- C.F.R., regulations, memos?
- presidential executive orders
- common law (constantly have to watch supreme court or appelate courts that interpret statutes)
# How Laws are Interpreted
- This is how the FTC started to go after companies in 1914
- Know about Wyndham and LABMD cases
- What is public policy as in "offends public policy"
# Chapter 1
- *"The United States does not have a national law that explicitly prescribes specific data security standards for all industries*
- the only explicit *federal* data security laws apply to companies that handle specific types of data
	- HIPAA
	- GLB
	- FERPA
	- ...
- Left to "re-interpret" existing laws to apply
# Who is the FTC?
- reports to congress
- headed by president
- [website](www.ftc.gov)
- **Mission**: protect consumers and promote competition
- Codifies USC into regulations (CFR) (see terminology for USC  meaning [[Cybersecurity Terminology]])
- Section 5 of FTC act (1914)
	- Prohibits *"Unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce"*
	- FTC claims authority for data security under "unfairness" prong of Section 5
	- Texas similar law - Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA)
# FTC Article 5
- Representation, omission, or practice is likely to mislead the consumer.
- Reasonableness from the perspective of the consumer
	- i.e.
		- buy a new computer with 30 day warranty, on day 31 you discover the camera never worked, and the company says no you had to fix it with the warranty. This is not reasonable to the consumer
- Material misrepresentation
	- i.e.
		- Saying we are going to use the highest government standards to protect your data, they then proceed to not encrypt, not monitor logs, etc. This would be material misrepresentation of what they said they would do
- FTC leading **regulatory agency** to data security
	- [[Cybersecurity Terminology]] NIST and US Cert are **not** regulatory agencies, however they are leading voices on encryption and data protection which means courts will listen to their prescriptive practices
	- If they do not exceed that which is defined by NIST, that's the default you should have
