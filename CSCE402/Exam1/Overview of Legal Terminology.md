# Difference between legal and engineering mindset
- tech
	- disruptive
	- problem solving
- law
	- reactive
	- set in established precedent
	- about the process
		- sometimes legal process over-rules common sense
- law always lags behind tech
## Vocab
- State vs. federal
- Double Jeopardy
- Constitutional rights (leave power to the states if it's not defined)
- 51 bodies of law
- Limits on "de novo" review
## Jurisdiction
 - Power of a court or locale to regulate the persons, objects, or conduct under their law
 - i.e. stolen vehicles
	 - gang stole cars from houston and by the time they knew they were in the middle of the gulf of mexico. Who has jurisdiction?
 - i.e. cybersecurity
	 - data is stolen and routed through multiple countries
	 - could be all jurisdictions
### Levels of Courts
- Fact finding court
	- state, federal: District
	- court like you normally see it
- appelate courts
	- state: 1-15 texas appellate courts
	- federal: 12 "circuit" courts
	- these can only review cases if there's a mistake in law and can only see in written record
- supreme courts
	- Texas: two
		- texas supreme court (civil)
		- texas court of criminal appeals (criminal)
	- federal: the supreme court of the united states for both civil and criminal
## Venue
- geographical term
- locale where case can be heard
## Standing
- Constitution Article III
- "Right" to bring a lawsuit
	- suffered an injury
	- injury must be traceable to Defendant's behavior
## Case/Controversy
- No advisory opinions
- Actual dispute b/w parties
- Actual conflict (not moot)
## Evidence Standards
- Civil
	- preponderance of the evidence
	- clear and convincing evidence
		- substantially more likely than not to be true
		- usually used in legal process
		- **CaC >> PoE**
- Criminal
	- **Beyond a reasonable doubt**
	- don't confuse with 4th amendment
		- reasonable belief and reasonable suspicion
		- credible evidence
- i.e.
	- OJ Simpson not convicted in criminal court but was found liable in civil court. They have different evidence standards
## Common law causes of action
- contract breach
- breach of implied warranty
- negligence
- unjust enrichment
- fraud

## Remedies
- depending on the cause of action the remedy (the rewards or damages rewarded) is different
- enforce a right or impose a penalty
- can be legal or equitable
	- legal
		- monetary damages i.e. compensatory
	- equitable
		- instead of a fine
			- injunction (stop what you're doing)
			- force to perform a contract
			- restitution
- normally these are in civil cases, criminal cases are normally prison time or fines
