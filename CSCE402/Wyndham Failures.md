- Storing credit card data in clear text
- Allowing simple passwords … systems that store sensitive data
- Failure to use firewalls and other “readily available security measures”
- Failure to adequately oversee cybersecurity of hotels that connect to Wyndham’s central servers
- Allowing vendors to have unnecessarily broad access to Wyndham servers
- Failure to take reasonable measure for security investigators or incident response
## Why is this important
- first case that determined that the FTC is the de facto regulator of private sector data security.
- Settled legal question:  “Does FTC have the authority to use FTC Act Section 5 to regulate data?”
	- “Most important case to date” – p 5
	- Wyndham’s argument: 
		- Congress has legislated industry-specific statutes.
		- If Congress wants FTC to have this authority, it would have passed a law. 
		- And we’re (Wyndham) the victim here so we can’t treat customers unfairly.
		- And the banana peel argument (p 9)
		- Violates Due Process Clause (p 9)
🡪 Yes, FTC has the authority to regulate data!
